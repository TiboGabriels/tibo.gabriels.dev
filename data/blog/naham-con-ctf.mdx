From the 28th of may to the 30th, nahamcon held a capture the flag event.
I hadn't done anything like it since my cyber security exam 2 years ago so i was curious what it would be like.

Before i could start i needed to join a team, or make one. But seeing some other people from howest in the roster i sent some messages and joined them.
They were all from cyber security so had much more experience than me. They told me they had another hackaton to do however so i had plenty of time to try
my hand before they did the harder ones. I started out with the warmups. Some were very easy: take a look at robots.txt to find the page with the flag.
But other challenges felt much more like an achievement. For one i had to upload an xml file and then execute it. But with a bit of hidden code i could
the flags content aswell!

Some were purely cryptograpghy related. One of my teammembers pointed me to the site [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/),
and i'm telling you, that site has almost everything you need!

One challenge in the miscelanious category was quite frustrating and fun at the same time. Whenami was its name.
I had to figure out how long ago a person
looked at their watch with bits of hint of times inbetween, while the person was jumping the date-line in samoa. I did
all this calculation, had a real crack at it! And failed. No idea were i was mistaken. So yeah i left it there.

After all the deadline passed i managed to do a few challenges. But what i found even more intresting was the writeups
people made afterwards! People explained how they did it, while also making reccomendations on how to proof you
applications and websites against these exploits.

Overal this was a real fun experience, no pressure, lot's of friendly people asking and giving hints all while learning more!
I prefered this much more than other hackatons.
