        From the 28th of may to the 30th, Nahamcon held a capture the flag event.
        I hadn't done anything like it since my cybersecurity exam 2 years ago, so I was curious what it would be like.

        Before I could start, I needed to join a team, or make one. But seeing some other people from Howest in the roster,
        I sent some messages and joined them. They were all from cybersecurity, so had much more experience than me.
        They told me they had another hackathon to do, however, so I had plenty of time to try
        my hand before they did the harder ones.

I started out with the warm-ups. Some were very easy: take a look at robots.txt to
find the page with the flag. But other challenges felt much more like an achievement. For one, I had to upload an XML file and then execute it.
But with a bit of hidden code I could the flags content as well!

Some were purely cryptography related. One of my team members pointed me to the site [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/),
and I'm telling you, that site has almost everything you need!

One challenge in the miscellaneous category was quite frustrating and fun at the same time. Whenami was its name.
I had to figure out how long ago a person
looked at their watch with bits of hint of times in between, while the person was jumping the date-line in Samoa. I did
all this calculation, had a real crack at it! And failed. No idea where I was mistaken. So yeah, I left it there.

After all the deadline passed, I managed to do a few challenges. But what I found even more interesting were the write-ups
people made afterwards! People explained how they did it, while also making recommendations on how to proof you
applications and websites against these exploits.

Overall this was a real fun experience, no pressure, lots of friendly people asking and giving hints all while learning more!
I preferred this much more than other hackathons.
