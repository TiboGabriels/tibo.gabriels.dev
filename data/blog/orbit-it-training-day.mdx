[Orbid](https://www.orbid.be) is a Belgian IT consultancy company. On the 21st April, they held an IT training day for up
and comming IT-consultants. This workshop would introduce us to Orbid, and how they run their IT Traineeships for multiple roles within Orbid.

I attended this event with the misinterpretation that this would be more general and not necessarily Orbid specific. But despite
this it did get me interested in applying for Orbid.
