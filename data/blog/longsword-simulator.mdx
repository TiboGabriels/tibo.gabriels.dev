I've been practicing HEMA(Historical European Martial Arts) For about 3 years now. Sometimes I just want to grab my
long sword and do some drills but sadly my room isn't quite as big as I'd like for that purpose. So in a productive mood
I decided to model the hilt in Fusion-360 and went ahead and printed it out. It came out quite well! But some weight could be useful.
I Will have to investigate if I can attach a weight to it somehow. For now it's really nice!
